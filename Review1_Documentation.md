## Student Record Management System - Mid-Project Evaluation

### Project Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Student Record Management System at the Review 1 milestone. The system demonstrates the practical implementation of custom data structures in a web-based application environment.

**Project Name:** Student Record Management System  
**Technology Stack:** Flask (Python), HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Bootstrap 5  
**Primary Innovation:** Custom data structures replacing traditional database operations  
**Review Status:** Mid-project checkpoint completed  

### Architecture and Design Decisions

#### System Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture pattern:
- **Presentation Layer:** HTML templates with Jinja2 templating engine
- **Application Layer:** Flask routes handling HTTP requests and responses
- **Business Logic Layer:** Custom data structure implementations
- **Data Persistence Layer:** JSON-based file storage system

#### Custom Data Structures Implementation
1. **LinkedList Structure**
   - Dynamic node-based storage for student records
   - Efficient insertion and deletion operations
   - Sequential access with search capabilities
   - Memory-efficient storage allocation

2. **Stack Implementation**
   - Operation history tracking for undo functionality
   - LIFO (Last In, First Out) operations
   - Configurable capacity limits
   - Support for rollback operations

3. **Queue Structure**
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - FIFO (First In, First Out) operations
   - Sequential task execution
   - Buffer management for operations

### Functional Requirements Achieved

#### Core CRUD Operations
- **Create:** Add new student records with validation
- **Read:** Display student data with filtering options
- **Update:** Modify existing student information
- **Delete:** Remove student records with confirmation

#### Advanced Features
- **Search Functionality:** Multi-field text search across student attributes
- **Query Engine:** SQL-like query processing for complex data retrieval
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Real-time statistics and performance metrics
- **Data Export:** JSON format export for data portability
- **Validation System:** Comprehensive input validation and error handling
